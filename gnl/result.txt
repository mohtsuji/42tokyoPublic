1:_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
1:Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
1:hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
1:got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
1:streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
1:late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
1:impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
1:East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
1:here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
1:rule.
1:
1:We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
1:Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
1:rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
1:very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
1:waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a
1:national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
1:Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
1:don't know how I should be able to get on without it.
1:
1:Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
1:British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
1:regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
1:country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
1:nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
1:extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
1:Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
1:mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
1:not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
1:Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
1:with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
1:town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
1:here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
1:travels with Mina.
1:
1:In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
1:Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
1:descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
1:East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
1:from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
1:the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
1:read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
1:horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
1:imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I
1:must ask the Count all about them.)
1:
1:I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
1:all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
1:window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
1:the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
1:still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
1:knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
1:I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
1:which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
1:very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe
1:for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
1:before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
1:the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
1:before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
1:more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?
1:
1:All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
1:beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
1:top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
1:rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
1:of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
1:running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
1:station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
1:of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
1:saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
1:and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
1:looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
1:about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
1:and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
1:fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
1:were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
1:Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
1:hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
1:heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
1:nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
1:had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
1:picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
1:set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
1:however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
1:self-assertion.
1:
1:It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
1:very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
1:Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
1:existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
1:of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
1:occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
1:a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
1:proper being assisted by famine and disease.
1:
1:Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
1:found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
1:course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
1:evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
1:cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
1:undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
1:fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
1:said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
1:smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
1:who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
1:a letter:--
1:
1:     "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
1:     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
1:     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
1:     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
1:     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
1:     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
1:
1:"Your friend,

1:"DRACULA."

1:_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
1:directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
1:making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
1:pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
1:true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
1:answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
1:lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
1:way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
1:was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
1:tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
1:and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
1:further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
1:any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
1:comforting.
1:
1:Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
1:very hysterical way:
1:
1:"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
1:state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
1:mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
1:was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
1:that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
1:she asked again:
1:
1:"Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
1:She shook her head as she said again:
1:
1:"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
1:my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
1:
1:"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
1:the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
1:full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
1:She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
1:without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
1:to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
1:ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
1:to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
1:tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
1:her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
1:dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
1:did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
1:taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
1:seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
1:state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
1:rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
1:of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
1:for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
1:round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
1:traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
1:am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
1:ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
1:coach!
